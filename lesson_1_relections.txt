Reflections of Version Control

How did viewing the difference b/w two versions help you spot the bug?
It helped by showing on the lines where there is a difference b/w the code. So I had lesser lines to compare manually.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Compare various versions to see which is more efficient. Refine new code to improve it further.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Manually choosing lets us set logical checkpoints which help in comparison. 
Automatic saving helps when people forget to save

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

The files which are interdependent required to be tracked together, to avoid breaking the operation.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows all the commits made in descending order, and see what change was made(message). 
git diff b/w two commits helps you compare two versions to see the lines added or removed.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

Reverting back to an earlier version is possible, which gives you the freedom to make extreme changes to the code. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
